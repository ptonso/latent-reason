# ðŸ§  Variational Autoencoder Playground

A modular and extensible framework for training, evaluating, and visualizing Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), including Î²-VAE variants. Built for research and experimentation across datasets such as CelebA, MNIST, dSprites, 3D Shapes, and more.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- ðŸ’¾ **Flexible Data Loading** via YAML config files (`train`, `val`, `test` paths).
- ðŸ§± **Modular Architecture** with customizable encoder/decoder configs.
- ðŸ”¬ **Evaluation Suite**:
  - Reconstruction visualization
  - Latent space PCA and dimension traversal
  - Latent statistics (Î¼, ÏƒÂ², KL contribution)
- ðŸ“ˆ **Training Engine** with:
  - Learning rate schedulers (`plateau`, `cosine`)
  - Early stopping and warm-up Î²
  - Resume from checkpoints
  - Loss and LR plots
- ðŸ§ª **Dataset Preparation Scripts** for CelebA, CIFAR-100, dSprites, COIL-100, ModelNet40, and 3D Shapes.
